# WittyCab
WittyCab is a decentralized cab ride booking platform, with drivers and riders, where riders can pay for rides with cryptocurrency.
Drivers receive their percentage of the payments for completed rides made to their wallets instantly whenever a rider makes payment.
Drivers are screened, approved and onboarded through a "Know Your Clients" (KYC) with a completely decentralized identity (DID).
Riders are authenticated with their wallet address, and are match to an available driver for their ride through geo-mapping.
Only electric cabs are allowed on the platform and accredited drivers are encouraged to access cab loans for electric cabs.
Qualified drivers can access Electric Cab loan, collaterized with certain daily percentage cash-flow from rides completed by drivers.
Once the Electric Cab loan payment is completed, the cab fully becomes the owner of the driver.
Crypto to cash equivalent will be displayed on the WittyCab platform for seamless payment transactions.
Payment of Electric Cab loan will be made in crypto, from the driver wallet to the WittyCab wallet.
